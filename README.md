# Emotion Classification with BERT

This project demonstrates fine-tuning a BERT model to classify English sentences into one of four emotional categories: **confidence**, **excite**, **inspire**, and **pleasure**.

## Features

- Uses Hugging Face's `transformers` and PyTorch
- Custom `EmotionDataset` class for handling text-label pairs
- Supports training, saving, loading, and evaluation
- Automatically saves a classification report to `.txt`

## Dataset Format

The dataset should be a CSV file (`emotion_labels_en.csv`) with the following format:

```csv
sentence,label
"I believe in myself and work hard to achieve success.",confidence
"Let's go! We can do it!",excite
...

```bash
pip install torch transformers scikit-learn pandas
```

Train and Save Model

```bash
python main.py
```

The classification report will be printed and saved to:
```bash
./data/bert_emotion_report.txt
```

## ðŸ“Š Example Classification Report

| Label      | Precision | Recall | F1-score | Support |
|------------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| confidence | 0.96      | 0.98   | 0.97     | 104     |
| excite     | 0.99      | 1.00   | 1.00     | 102     |
| inspire    | 0.99      | 0.97   | 0.98     | 104     |
| pleasure   | 0.98      | 0.97   | 0.98     | 104     |
| **Accuracy** |           |        | **0.98** | 414     |
| **Macro avg** | 0.98   | 0.98   | 0.98     | 414     |
| **Weighted avg** | 0.98 | 0.98 | 0.98     | 414     |
